# Database Migration - LocalStorage to MongoDB

## Overview
Migrated the application from localStorage-based data storage to MongoDB database storage for production use.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Created Posts Controller (`backend/controllers/postsController.js`)
- **New endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/posts` - Get all posts (public, paginated)
  - `GET /api/posts/:id` - Get single post
  - `POST /api/posts` - Create new post (protected)
  - `PUT /api/posts/:id` - Update post (protected)
  - `DELETE /api/posts/:id` - Delete post (protected)
  - `PUT /api/posts/:id/like` - Like/unlike post (protected)

#### 2. Created Posts Routes (`backend/routes/posts.js`)
- Public routes for viewing posts
- Protected routes for creating, updating, deleting posts
- Authorization checks to ensure users can only modify their own posts

#### 3. Updated Post Model (`backend/models/Post.js`)
- Added `id` field to support UUID-based posts (for migration compatibility)
- Field is unique and sparse to allow null values

#### 4. Updated Server (`backend/server.js`)
- Added posts routes: `app.use('/api/posts', postsRoutes)`

#### 5. Updated Admin Controller (`backend/controllers/adminController.js`)
- Modified `deletePost` to handle both MongoDB ObjectId and UUID formats
- Ensures backward compatibility during migration

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Updated HomePage (`src/pages/HomePage.js`)
- **Upload function:**
  - Changed from saving to localStorage to POST request to `/api/posts`
  - Requires authentication token
  - Saves posts directly to MongoDB database
  
- **Load function:**
  - Changed from reading localStorage to GET request from `/api/posts`
  - Fetches posts from database on component mount
  - Formats posts for display from database response

- **Removed:**
  - localStorage read/write operations
  - `getVideos()` function no longer uses localStorage

#### 2. Updated AdminDashboard (`src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.js`)
- **Fetch content:**
  - Removed localStorage fallback mechanism
  - Now fetches directly from database API
  - No longer saves API responses to localStorage
  
- **Delete content:**
  - Removed localStorage update logic
  - Only updates UI state after successful API deletion
  - Uses admin endpoint: `/api/admin/posts/:id`

- **Delete post confirmation:**
  - Uses admin endpoint for deletion
  - Removed all localStorage manipulation

## Migration Path

### For Existing LocalStorage Data
1. **Option 1 - Manual Migration:**
   - Use the "Sync with Database" button in admin dashboard
   - This will upload all localStorage posts to the database

2. **Option 2 - Fresh Start:**
   - Clear localStorage
   - Create new posts which will be saved to database

### User Data
- Users are automatically saved to MongoDB through registration
- No migration needed for users (they were already in database)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Backend routes created and registered
- [x] Post creation saves to database
- [x] Posts load from database on page refresh
- [x] Admin can view all posts
- [x] Admin can delete posts from database
- [x] User pagination works correctly
- [ ] Test post creation with images
- [ ] Test post creation with videos
- [ ] Test post likes functionality
- [ ] Test post comments functionality

## Important Notes

1. **Authentication Required:**
   - Users must be logged in to create posts
   - Token is required for all protected endpoints

2. **Data Persistence:**
   - All new data is stored in MongoDB only
   - LocalStorage is NO LONGER used for data storage
   - Only authentication tokens remain in localStorage

3. **Pagination:**
   - Backend supports pagination with `page` and `limit` query parameters
   - User table pagination should now work correctly

4. **Admin Privileges:**
   - Admins can view and delete all posts
   - Regular users can only modify their own posts

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly
2. Clear localStorage to verify database-only operation
3. Monitor database for proper data storage
4. Consider adding image upload functionality
5. Implement proper error handling for offline scenarios
